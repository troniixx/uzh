define array

if a[0] > a[1] then: a[1] = second and a[0] = largest
else: a[0] = second and a[1] = largest

for every element in a, starting at a[2]:
    if largest <  current index:
        second = largest
        largest = current index
    else if second < current index:
        second = current index

print out the second and the largest element
