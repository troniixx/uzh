# Task 1

1. Given an empty stack S, illustrate the result of each operation in the sequence push(4), push(1),
push(3), pop(), push(8), and pop(S).
> - 4
> - 1 4
> - 3 1 4
> - 1 4
> - 8 1 4
> - NULL

2. Given an empty queue Q, illustrate the result of each operation in the sequence enqueue(4),
enqueue(1), enqueue(3), dequeue(), enqueue(8), and dequeue().

3. Explain how to implement two stacks in one array A[] in such a way that neither stack overflows
unless the total number of elements in both stacks together is n. The push and pop operations
should run in O(1) time.

4. Explain how to implement a queue Q′ using two stacks. Analyze the running time of the enqueue
and dequeue operations on Q′.

5. Explain how to implement a stack S′ using two queues. Analyze the running time of the pop
and push operations on S′.
