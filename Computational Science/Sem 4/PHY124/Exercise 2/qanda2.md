- Structure of a for-loop
  for item in iterable:
      body

- Use for vs. while
  - for: when you know the number of iterations or are iterating over a collection
  - while: when looping until a condition changes

- Use of break, continue, and else in loops:  
  - break: exits the loop immediately
  - continue: skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next
  - else: runs only if the loop completes normally

- Asking the user for input:  
  user_input = input("Prompt message:")

- Combining strings:  
  - Use +,f-strings or .format()

- Creating a string with newlines:  
  - Use the newline character \n

- Meaning of None:  
  - Represents the absence of a value

- Representing boolean value:  
  - True and False

- Purpose of range(...) and its arguments:  
  - Generates a sequence of numbers, commonly used in loops
  - Typical forms: range(stop), range(start, stop), range(start, stop, step)

- Indexing and slicing:  
  - Indexing: sequence[index] accesses an item by its position (starting at 0)
  - Slicing: sequence[start:end:step]

- Converting between Unicode characters and code points:  
  - Character to code point: ord('A')
  - Code point to character: chr(65)
