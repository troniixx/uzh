            "I've seen the opposite. Processing times for Non-EU study visas can be fairly quick.\n\nIs there any reason you haven't started the process now, though? Iirc, what matters are the letter of acceptance and proof of funds. The university diploma is more of an ETH requirement, and they generally give you several weeks after the start of the semester to present the physical diploma.\n\nMy recommendation would be to get the paperwork in now. Make sure you have a bank account with a bank permitted by the Canton of Zürich with sufficient proof of funds (different cantons allow different banks).\n\nAlso, if you haven't already done so, reach out to the student housing cooperatives, immediately, to begin your housing search.\n\nEdit: It looks like the university diploma depends on what the embassy in your particular country requires, and it can apparently vary. If you haven't spoken with them, it may be worth while to ask if this is an actual need, and if either a transcript or written confirmation that you will be graduating is sufficient.",
            "I am still in my bachelor's degree, 4-th course. Local embassy requires at least a proof that I've passed all the exams, and I'm working on it.\n\nFurthermore, my family will have to take a debt to provide 21000 CHF to the embassy if I send the visa application before July (That's when I'll get the results about government scholarship).\n\nMoreover, If I don't get a scholarship, I'm willing to risk taking debt and somehow working in parallel to get 21000 for the next year's permit renewal. And eventually, hoping to get a job to pay the debt of my family.\n\n  \nAnother concern is identifying a bank listed by FINMA that imposes minimal charges for depositing money from my native bank account, as none of my native banks are included in the FINMA list.",
            "Start putting out feelers for Research Assistant positions. You can usually use a work contract to offset part of the required proof of funds. This may not come through in time for your visa, but it will help for your renewal and to cover your actual living expenses, which are going to be higher than you expect.\n\nDepartments will generally start asking for CVs in June or July, but they usually only ask students enrolled in their graduate programs. You can, however, work in Departments or even Universities that are different from the one you’re enrolled in. Being proactive really helps here. It also helps that RA positions are gateways for PhD positions, which are much harder to get.\n\nAlso keep an eye on Swiss job boards. Many groups will post RA positions on them. You will not be able to start working until you’re in country, have your B permit, and a signed contract, but the sooner you start looking the better off you’ll be. ",
            "> Another concern is identifying a bank listed by FINMA that imposes minimal charges for depositing money from my native bank account, as none of my native banks are included in the FINMA list.\n\nThis is worth a separate post. Look into Wise or IBKR, assuming that Interactive Brokers operates in your country, which they likely do. Minimal currency conversion costs. \n\nThat said, I would be surprised if one of the major Swiss banks (UBS/Credit Suisse) didn’t have a branch in your country, even if they don’t advertise it. Also keep in mind that many American banks are accepted by Canton Zurich.",

            "Take my point of view with a grain of salt since probably you know more than me about these fields, but I would do the one in electrical engineering and machine learning without a doubt.\nYou will have a lot more job possibilities in various field (also in finance!) surely with a very high salary, so I wouldn't worry about that.\nThe only pro of the other course is that you wouldn't have to relocate and make new friends which is very tough.\nAnyways, they are both incredibly good choices, so I wouldn't worry too much.",
            "I'm with @salty on this one. Studying electrical engineering won't exclude quantitative finance. I'm sure especially with the ML part that you could go into it more quickly. Another aspect you might want to consider is that moving another place might be a good way to get you put of your comfort zone and grow a little. I think it also looks good in your resume to show that you've been to more than one place.",

            "Thank you very much for your response! I am currently finishing my final year of bachelor’s year in exchange year at TU München, but I think you are right. It’s a good idea to add as much as variety as possible, so maybe it’s a better idea to go to Zürich instead of going back to Lausanne."

            "This is just stupid, it is an inclusive part of your studies and you must be able to find someone without any issue.\n\nFailing a master thesis is almost unheard of, I guess some professor are too pretentious and only aim for top students pretending it is a job application, which is not.\n\nThankfully I didn't have that problem but I know many people who did. ETH needs to tell its profs to lower their ego a little bit!",
            "Hi, I had this problem last year. I was also in math msc and had an average of 4.2 lol  \nYou will not be kicked out of the program for sure. Every student writes a thesis, regardless of average.  \nWhat are you interested in? There is also the possibility of writing your thesis in a different department (I wrote mine in D-INFK on machine learning, with a supervisor from D-MATH; I did, however, do my bachelors at ETH too so my math supervisor was my bachelor thesis supervisor).\n\nFor me, the most effective method was going to professors in person, either in lectures or at academic events, and asking them directly. It took me 2 months to find my thesis, so be patient. You can also ask your TAs, who are usually PhD students, if they have any thesis opportunities in their groups. Professors are super busy and barely respond to emails so going to any office hours is the best bet. Good luck!",
            "I would send a single follow up email if you did not receive a response within 2 weeks. Professors get quite a large number of emails, and something like this would probably be lower on their priority of things to reply to. A single follow up email if you didn't get a response would be fine, just kindly word it.",

You might be offered to put some one in CC of your mail to motivate teacher to read/answer your email.\n\nSome teacher are delusional about student capacity or interest in projects. Rejections can be really hard to deal with especially when you just end your exam and needs some confidence boost.\n\nThe school will never throw you away for not finding a master project if you are actively looking for one.\n\nIt can be hard or easy, some teacher ask very tough question about papers they published others doesn't even read your CV or grades to take some one for a thesis. It's depends.\n\nKeep in mind things are often not easy for the teacher/lab as well.",

            "Yeah as far as I know Bandeira rejects many. Just keep looking, you’ll fine somebody eventually. But to be fair it doesn’t sound like you are asking everybody, you have specific ideas in mind and ofc this will make things harder."

            "If you tell us what you study, we can dig up the relevant regulations for you. ETH-wide, there are no such constraints but your specific program might have constraints.",
            "No. I took (well repeated) a course of 9 credits during my master thesis (I could skip the project thought, I only had to do the exam)\n\nOn top of that I took a SHS course of 2 credits. So overall 11 credits on top of the thesis.\n\nOverall it as bit of a pain but it only had a minimal impact on my thesis overall.\n\nMy impression is that you can organize your studies as you wish (just take care of deadlines), but try and make sound decisions and plan well.\n\nEdit: yes, in CS you need to have passed the interfocus courses, some majors courses and have a least amount of credit point.",

            "Missing credits for your Bachelor’s degree that is! As you may know as an ETH student you can enroll in a Masters program ahead of finishing your Bachelor’s degree. This might for example be useful if you only have a small number of ECTS left so you already want to start doing you master courses. This means you can finish all Master courses before applying for your Bachelor’s degree. In order to prevent people from finishing a Masters degree without a Bachelor’s degree, this rule (probably) exists",
            "In that case, you need to have completed your BSc, completed the admission prerequisits (in case that you got some), completed at least two core courses, completed at least five courses (including a seminar) in fields of specialization, completed the semester paper and either have taken Scientific Works in Mathematics or Scientific Works in Physicsis. If you satisfy those constraints but have credits missing, then that's not an issue - you can do those remaining credits next to or even after the master's thesis."
