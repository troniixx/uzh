# University of Zürich (UZH)
I'm currently in the first year and in thsi repo I'll post all Coding/Compsci related stuff from Uni.
Feel free to send pull requests, changes etc. I will send you a message once I approved them.
Ideas and help is always welcome! I'm still learning. According to the study guide, we'll be using Python, Java, C and I'll also upload the exercises in the languages i want to learn in my free time (prob Ruby, C++, JavaScript - but no promises on those).
