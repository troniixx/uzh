# University of ZÃ¼rich (UZH)

I'm currently enrolled in the University of Zurich to study computer science with a focus on sofware systems and in this repo I'll post all Coding/Compsci related tasks or interesting concepts we learned in the lectures from my different courses (I'll promise to do my best to create an amazing folder strucutre <3).
Feel free to send pull requests, changes, more efficient solutions, etc. I will send you a message once I approved them and ofc to thank you :3.
Fun ideas and tips and trick are always welcome! I'm open to learn as many new things as possible. According to our study guide, we'll be using Python, Java and C but I'll also upload the exercises in the languages I want to learn just to flex with them on LinkedIn. (prob Ruby, C++, JavaScript - but no promises on those. I'm a lazy man :) ).
