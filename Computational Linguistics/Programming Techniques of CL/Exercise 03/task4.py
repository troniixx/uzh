import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

stopwords = set(stopwords.words("english"))  # use this set for removing the stopwords

# take a look at the stopwords by printing them (and print the type â€“ so you see it really is a set): 
print (stopwords)
print(type(stopwords))

# TODO your implementation here
