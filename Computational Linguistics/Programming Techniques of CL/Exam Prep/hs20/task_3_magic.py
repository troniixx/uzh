# Clair Chaos wrote a program in order to test whether you have the magical power to correctly guess the number that a dice rolls.
# Actually, the program lets you guess infinitely until you predict the correct number.
# But your chances are always 1/6 to predict the rolled number.
# Every non-integer is silently ignored and the user is prompted
# So, everyone is a bit of a magician in the end...
# Unfortuately, Clair Chaos mixed up all lines and lost the indentation. Can you please help her to reconstruct the program.
# IMPORTANT: Please write a short comment BEFORE EACH LINE that explains what the next line does.
