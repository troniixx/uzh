    <h1>Four Swiss German words you can’t translate into English</h1>

    <p class="lead">Some Swiss German words are so culturally specific, or just so strange, that it is impossible to
        translate them – at least not in a simple, elegant way. Here are some of our favourites.

    <h2 lang="gsw">Bettmümpfeli</h2>
    <p>
        Did you wake up with crumbs in the bed this morning? Or was there a mysterious plate by the kitchen sink when
        you went to make coffee? Chances are that someone in the house got an attack of the late-night munchies, or as
        it called in Swiss German, a <span lang="gsw">Bettmümpfeli</span>.</p>

    <h2 lang="gsw">Feierabend</h2>
    <p>
        The Swiss work a lot: around 40 to 42 hours a week is average for a full-time job at a Swiss company. But the
        plus side is that, generally speaking, the Swiss don’t take their work home. That magical moment when the
        working day is done and you are free to leave is known as <span lang="gsw">Feierabend</span> (literally
        ‘celebration
        evening’) and is pronounced something like <span lang="gsw">Fürabet</span> – depending, of course, what part of
        Switzerland you are
        in. You could, for example, ask someone: <span lang="gsw">‘Wenn hesch fürabet?’</span>, which means "When do you
        get
        off?".</p>

    <h2 lang="gsw">Schafsseckel</h2>
    <p>
        No list of Swiss German words would be complete without one swear word containing a) a reference to an animal
        and b) a reference to an anatomical nether region. In this case, the animal is a sheep (Schaf) and the part of
        the anatomy is the testicles (from <span lang="gsw">‘Seckel’</span> meaning something like bag). Although the
        word
        might sound cute, it is a strong insult akin to ‘wanker’ or ‘asshole’. You have been warned.</p>

    <h2 lang="gsw">Röstigraben</h2>
    <p>
        The Germans had the Berliner Mauer (Berlin Wall) and Donald Trump wants to build a wall with Mexico but in
        Switzerland, the cultural and linguistic divide between the French and German-speaking parts of the country is
        an
        invisible border
        known as the <span lang="gsw">Röstigraben</span> after the typically Swiss German potato dish <span
            lang="gsw">Rösti</span>. Our translation: the potato dish
        ditch.</p>
