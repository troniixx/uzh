    "This is an non-graded exercise, but you can submit your solution to get feedback from us. Make sure to submit your code through GitLab before **April 9th at 23:59**. Late submissions will not be considered for feedback. Please make sure to stick to Python best practices and documenting your code appropriately with comments and docstrings."
