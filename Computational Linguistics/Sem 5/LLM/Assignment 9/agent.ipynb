        "In this part of the assignment you will build a **simple agentic system** using the `smolagents` library.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, make sure to read the [guided tour](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/v1.23.0/en/guided_tour) of the library. It contains explanations about everything you will need to complete your tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Goal.** Your agent should be able to provide the user with *song lyrics* by:\n",
        "1. Calling a custom retrieval tool `get_lyrics(title, artist=None)`, accepting a song title and optionally the artist name as inputs. The tool looks up lyrics in a Hugging Face dataset and return it as a string.\n",
        "2. Using an LLM (namely gemini-2.5-flash-lite) via `smolagents` to decide when to call the tool and to return the retrieved lyrics to the user exactly as stored in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the artist is not provided, your tool should search by title only and return the best match.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example.**  \n",
        "If the user asks:\n",
        "\n",
        "> “Give me the lyrics of 'Imagine' by John Lennon.”\n",
        "\n",
        "the agent should:\n",
        "1. Call `get_lyrics(title=\"Imagine\", artist=\"John Lennon\")` **OR** `get_lyrics(title=\"Imagine\", artist=None)` if no artist was provided in the user prompt  \n",
        "2. Receive the raw lyrics text as tool output  \n",
        "3. Read those lyrics and generate an answer like “Here are the Lyrics for the song 'Imagine' by John Lennon: Imagine there's no heaven It's easy if you try No hell below us Above us, only sky ...”\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "You will:\n",
        "- inspect the Hugging Face lyrics dataset,\n",
        "- implement the `get_lyrics` tool,\n",
        "- plug it into a `ToolCallingAgent`,\n",
        "- and experiment with a few queries to analyse how well the agent uses the tool."
